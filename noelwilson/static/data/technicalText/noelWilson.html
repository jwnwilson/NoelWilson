<pre class="whiteText">
This website has been built by me to show off other projects I have also 
created. The initial plan is to create a simple mainly HTML/ CSS powered
website which I will then use as a base to be improved upon with javascript,
JQuery and Node.

I expect this website to change wildly as I experiemnt with new libraries and 
learn new techniques. At the moment most changes will be under the hood as I
try different approachs to keep to DRY principles and try other people's ideas
from public github repositories.
