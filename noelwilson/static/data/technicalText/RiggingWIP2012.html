<pre class="whiteText">
I am a rigger / scripter / programmer working currently in Maya writing plugins 
and tools, I am currently using mostly MEL and python to create my tools. 

This is a working in progress video of a rigging tool I am developing, it is 
intended to be a complete framework which will allow continuous addition of 
modular components which can be combined to create almost any type of rig.

The main structure is now complete and I will begin to populate the tool with 
more modules. Work on deformation tools will follow shortly which I will base 
on some existing free scripts but will integrate seamlessly into my project.



All the code for this project is in my github account
